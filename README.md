## Compilr

An online compiler for C, Java and Python.

To get started, run the following commands:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

This creates images and containers for the compilers, the web client and server.
It also initialises a docker swarm and deploys the services locally.

After running the setup script, the web client can be accessed at `localhost:3000` and the server at `localhost:8080`.
